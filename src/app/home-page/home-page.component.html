      <h2>Why Use Lifting Buddy?</h2>
      <p>
        Logging your workouts manually is tedious. Lifting Buddy provides a
        clean, centralized way to track and visualize your progress. See which
        muscles you're hitting the most, where you're lagging, and how youâ€™re
        improving over time. Stay motivated and optimize your routine with data
        that matters.

    <h2>How Does Lifting Buddy Track Progress?</h2>
    <p>
      Lifting buddy tracks progress using statistics based off the total volume
      worked per muscle group or exercise. The volume for a set is not simply
      the number of reps multiplied by the weight. It is weighted using an
      effort factor that increases the volume for fewer reps.
